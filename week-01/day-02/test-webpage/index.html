    <p class="firstParagraph">I love to design complex systems with high level of automation including Ai and robotics. I'm deeply interested in inventing
        new things that can augment the human experience. Everything I've done, everything I'll do today, everything I'll
        ever do, I do to protect this world. Someone once told me that with great power comes great responsibility.</p>

    <p>All computers run using very low-level commands which do some very basic functions, such as reading data, writing data,
        jumping to addresses, and calculating basic arithmetic. (The complete list of commands that can be run by a CPU is
        known as that)</p>
